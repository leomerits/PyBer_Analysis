# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the Ride Share Analysis
   
In this project, we are to perform an indept analysis of PyBer ride sharing data in three types of cities: Rural. Urban, and Suburban so as to understand the fare metricts based on the type of citythat PyBer operates. Being able to create visual representation of the rideshare data helped PyBer improve in their services to the city, not only the big and known cities, but also the undderserved neighborhoods as well.
    
# Resources
- Data Source: city_data_csv, PyBer_ride_data_csv, ride_data_csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter

# Results
   
It was shown that there is a larger demand of riders for PyBer in the urban cities compared to the suburban and rural cities as we can see on the figure below.

Aagain, it was shown thata there were larger volume of drivers which in turn increased the total volume of fares in urban cities in comparism to the suburban and rural cities as was dipicted by the graphs below.

# Summary
On the multiple line graph, it was also shown thaturban cities had the highest total fare wthin the months of January, February, March and April more than suburban and rural cities. Through this project, PyBer was able to see that majority of there revenue comes from the urban city, which also means that majority of their drivers are centered around the urban cities, which, even though it was not a part of this analysis, their highes insurance payout would also have been around this same cities.
